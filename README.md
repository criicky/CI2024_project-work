## Symbolic Regression

This project focuses on implementing a [Genetic Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_programming) algorithm for the [Symbolic Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_regression).
Symbolic Regression is like a treasure hunt for the perfect mathematical equation to describe a dataset - [**_Casper Wilstrup_**](https://medium.com/@wilstrup/symbolic-regression-a-simple-and-friendly-introduction-16bcadbe870a)
It analyzes data in order to find the best mathematical rappresentation for them. It searches through a vast space of mathematical expression until it finds the one that best fits the data and it is also simple for us humans to understand it.

The problem is described as follows:
> Given a dataset that consists in inputs and their respective outputs, the goal is to find a symbolic expression that closely approximates the relationship between the pairs. In this project, we will be working with eight different datasets.
